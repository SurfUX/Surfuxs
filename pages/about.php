                practical digital solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our work spans four core areas:
                <strong>Care Technology, Software Development,
                Web Development and Social Media Marketing.</strong>
                Each capability supports a different part of an
                organization's digital journey.

            <p>
                From developing a management system and launching a
                business website to building a digital presence and
                creating specialized care technology, we focus on
                solutions that are useful, clear and built around
                the people who use them.

        <div class="rich-copy">

            <p>
                One of our key areas of focus is Care Technology: creating digital
                care management systems that help elder homes, child-care
                organizations, residential care facilities, charities and
                NGOs manage people, information and daily operations more
                effectively.
            </p>

            <p>
                This vision led to
                <strong>CareSphere</strong> — an integrated care
                management platform developed by SurfUX.
            </p>

            <p>
                CareSphere brings specialized solutions together
                under one ecosystem, including
                <strong>CareSphere Elder, CareSphere Child,
                CareSphere Residential and CareSphere Charity.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                Our goal is to make specialized care management technology more
                practical and accessible for organizations working in
                elder care, child care, residential care, accommodation
                and social impact.
